# Adverse-Event-Tabulation-LGG-
Tabulation of Adverse Events in the Low Grade Glioma Clinical Trial LGG Lysate


#This RMD accepts decoded adverse event data captured and generated in OnCore, formats the requested adverse events relevant to the LGG study, and tabulates them using the table1 function in R.

#Data formatting includes dividing adverse events between arms and grade and dropping unrelated and unlikely attributions.

#Of note is that I decided to create two tables and copy and paste them after knitting to HTML for easier formatting and less code written.

#Tables and plots can be dragged and dropped or coppied and pasted from html to word. This keeps all formatting.
